🌐 Live Demo: Todo App

🚀 Key Features
Navigation with React Router: Effortless navigation between the Home and About pages without the need for page reloads, thanks to React-Router-Dom.
Fully Responsive UI: The app is designed with Bootstrap to ensure it looks sleek and operates smoothly across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Instant Alerts: Users are instantly alerted when they try to add a Todo with missing title or description, ensuring a smoother experience.
Dynamic Todos Display: Todos are only shown if explicitly added, resolving the previous issue where todos persisted after a page reload.
✨ Enhanced Functionality
Persistent Todos Fix: A major milestone—todos will no longer persist after a page reload unless added by the user, ensuring a cleaner and more intentional user experience.
Input Validation: Users will be alerted when trying to add a Todo without a title or description, improving usability and preventing errors.
📊 Notable Changes
🔍 Previous Challenge
In the last iteration, deleted todos would linger and persist across page reloads, which created confusion for users.
🌟 Current Improvement
The latest version addresses this problem by ensuring todos are displayed only when explicitly added. Now, any deleted todos will not reappear after reloading the page.
